        "question": "Which countries are eligible?",
        "answer": "From Nov 7, 2024 to Nov 8, 2025, nationals of 89 countries (e.g., Mexico, Guatemala, Colombia, Spain, the Philippines) are eligible. Employers may also request workers from non-listed countries on a case-by-case basis."
      },
      "q7": {
        "question": "What is the Temporary Worker Program?",
        "answer": "It’s the broader H-2 framework (H-2A + H-2B). Employers first secure a Department of Labor temporary labor certification, then file Form I-129 with USCIS; approved workers apply for the visa or entry inspection at a U.S. consulate/port."
      },
      "q8": {
        "question": "What happens if the economy is affected?",
        "answer": "Downturn: Employers submit fewer petitions; some contracts end early (employers must pay return travel). Labor shortage despite slowdown: DHS can release supplemental visas—FY 2025 added 64,716 extra H-2B slots beyond the 66 000 cap."

      "q1": {
        "question": "How long does the H-2B process take?",
        "answer": "Plan on about four to six months from first paperwork to worker arrival. Employers should request the prevailing-wage determination at least 60 days in advance, file the temporary labor-certification 75–90 days before the start date (inside the DOL three-day filing window), wait roughly 30 days for DOL review, and then allow up to 15 calendar days for USCIS adjudication if Premium Processing is used, plus time for consular interviews and travel."
      },
      "q2": {
        "question": "How long does the visa last?",
        "answer": "The visa’s validity matches the employer’s certified “period of need,” usually up to nine months for seasonal or peak-load work. Extensions are possible in one-year blocks, but a worker’s total stay in H-2B status cannot exceed three years."
      },
      "q3": {
        "question": "How long does the recruitment phase last?",
        "answer": "After the job order is accepted, the employer must post a notice for at least 15 consecutive business days and continue accepting U.S. applicants until 21 days before the date of need. In practice, gathering résumés, interviewing, and writing the recruitment report takes three to four weeks."
      },
      "q4": {
        "question": "What is the fiscal year (FY) and how does it influence my visa?",
        "answer": "The U.S. government FY runs October 1 – September 30. The statutory cap of 66,000 H-2B visas is split: 33,000 for jobs starting Oct 1–Mar 31 and 33,000 for Apr 1–Sep 30. Your target start date decides which half-year cap you fall under and when you are allowed to file."
      },
      "q5": {
        "question": "When is the best time of year to apply?",
        "answer": "File on the first day of the DOL three-day window that opens 90 days before the work start date. For winter positions beginning October 1, the window opens July 3–5; for spring/summer jobs beginning April 1, it opens early January. Submitting on day one maximizes the chance of getting a slot before the cap fills."
      },
      "q6": {
        "question": "What does “Current Fiscal Year Cap” mean?",
        "answer": "USCIS tracks how many petitions have counted toward each 33,000-visa allotment. When it announces the cap is “reached,” new cap-subject filings for that half-year are rejected or shifted to any supplemental pool; employers must wait for the next season or qualify for an exemption."
      },
      "q7": {
        "question": "How many H-2B visas are issued per year?",
        "answer": "Congress sets 66,000 base visas. For FY 2025, DHS added 64,716 supplemental visas, raising the practical ceiling to about 130,716 slots."
      },
      "q8": {
        "question": "What is the H-2B Returning Worker Exception?",
        "answer": "Of the FY 2025 supplemental visas, 44,716 are reserved for “returning workers”—people who held H-2B status in any of the three previous fiscal years. These beneficiaries do not count against the 66,000 cap, giving experienced employees (and their employers) faster access."

    "workerRequirements": {
      "q1": {
        "question": "What requirements must I meet?",
        "answer": "You must be from an eligible country, be physically able to work, and have a valid job offer from a U.S. employer approved by USCIS."
      },
      "q2": {
        "question": "What documents do I need?",
        "answer": "You’ll need a valid passport, job offer or contract, Form DS-160 confirmation, and an approved petition (I-129) from the employer."
      },
      "q3": {
        "question": "What medical tests are required?",
        "answer": "You may be asked for a basic physical exam or vaccinations, depending on consular processing country policies."
      },
      "q4": {
        "question": "What level of English do I need?",
        "answer": "English is not mandatory, but basic understanding may help during the visa interview or job performance, depending on the role."
      },
      "q5": {
        "question": "How does my nationality affect my application?",
        "answer": "Only nationals of countries listed by DHS as eligible for H-2A/H-2B visas can be approved without a special employer request."
      },
      "q6": {
        "question": "How does my marital status affect it?",
        "answer": "Your marital status doesn’t affect eligibility, but spouses and children (H-4 visas) can’t work in the U.S."
      },
      "q7": {
        "question": "What happens if I get arrested?",
        "answer": "An arrest—especially involving drugs, violence, or immigration fraud—may lead to visa denial depending on severity and disposition."
      },
      "q8": {
        "question": "How does my immigration history affect the process?",
        "answer": "Previous deportations, visa overstays, or illegal presence can result in bans or denials; clean history helps with approval."
      },
      "q9": {
        "question": "What if I overstay my visa?",
        "answer": "Overstaying can trigger a 3 or 10-year reentry bar and affect future visa eligibility, especially for H-2 programs."
      }
    },
    "contracts": {
      "q1": {
        "question": "What is a sponsor?",
        "answer": "A sponsor is the U.S. employer or agent who files the H-2B or H-2A petition and agrees to hire and follow the program’s legal requirements."
      },
      "q2": {
        "question": "How do I sign a contract?",
        "answer": "You sign a written employment agreement with the employer or recruiter before traveling, detailing wages, job duties, housing (if applicable), and terms of employment."
      },
      "q3": {
        "question": "How do I verify if a contract is real?",
        "answer": "Cross-check with official job listings, verify the employer’s name with USCIS approval, and never pay recruiters without confirmed documentation."
      },
      "q4": {
        "question": "What happens if the sponsor violates the contract?",
        "answer": "You can report violations to the Department of Labor or a local U.S. consulate. Employers can face penalties, debarment, and civil lawsuits."
      },
      "q5": {
        "question": "What are the employer’s obligations?",
        "answer": "Employers must provide fair wages, working conditions, return travel (in many cases), and, for H-2A, free housing and meals or kitchen access."
      },
      "q6": {
        "question": "What happens if the employer doesn’t pay or shuts down?",
        "answer": "You may be eligible for back wages or assistance through the Department of Labor. Seek consular support and avoid unauthorized employment."
      },
      "q7": {
        "question": "What documents must the employer provide?",
        "answer": "They must give you a copy of the work contract, job order, and USCIS-approved petition notice (Form I-797)."
      },
      "q8": {

        "answer": "The fee for most non-immigrant visas, including H-2A and H-2B, is currently $205 USD. It must be paid before the visa interview."
      },
      "q4": {
        "question": "What is the difference between visa stamp and visa status?",
        "answer": "The visa stamp allows you to enter the U.S.; your status is what you maintain while inside the U.S. with a valid I-94 during authorized stay."
      },
      "q5": {
        "question": "What is a non-immigrant visa?",
        "answer": "It’s a temporary visa for individuals entering the U.S. for a specific purpose (e.g., work, tourism, study) with a defined end date."
      },
      "q6": {
        "question": "What is a U.S. Consular Section?",

      "q2": {
        "question": "Do I need a new visa for the extension?",

      },
      "q3": {
        "question": "What if the contract is canceled?",

        "question": "What if my employer doesn’t request the extension in time?",
